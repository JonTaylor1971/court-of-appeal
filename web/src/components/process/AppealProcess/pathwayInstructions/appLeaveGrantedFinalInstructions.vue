            An order (
            <a href="https://www.bccourts.ca/Court_of_Appeal/practice_and_procedure/Forms/Form%2023.pdf"
               target="_blank">Form 23</a>
            ) needs to be prepared when the Court of Appeal has given its
            decision in chambers or after the appeal hearing. The parties,
            not the court, are responsible for preparing the order. Any 
            party can prepare the order, but usually the successful party 
            does so.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The signatures of all parties must be collected on the order before submitting 
            it to the registry for entry. If someone refuses to sign an order, you may go before the 
            registrar to settle the order.
