            Scanning using a Scanner connected to a Computer
        </h2>
        <p >
            If you have a scanner (maybe multi-function printers are also capable of scanning documents), the easiest way to scan your documents may be to use a purpose built scanner.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li ><b>Microsoft Windows - </b> If you are using a Microsoft operating system such as Windows 10 there is built-in software to allow you to scan documents. For more information see Microsoft’s help on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/14088/windows-10-install-and-use-a-scanner" target='_blank' >Installing and Using a Scanner in Windows 10.</a></li>
            <li ><b>Apple OS X - </b>If you are using a Macintosh computer there is built-in software to allow you to scan documents. For more information see Apple’s help <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh28032/mac" target='_blank' >Scanning images or documents using your Mac.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p >
            There are other third party scanning options for both Windows and Mac. Most scanners come with software that will help you scan your documents. Refer to the documentation that came with your scanner for more information.

        <p>
            Once you have created a PDF or JPG for each document or a PDF with all the documents, you can attach those into the email to the court registry.

            Scanning using a Smart Phone Camera
        </h2>
        <p>
            Most modern mobile phones have a built-in camera that takes good enough pictures to serve as a document scanner. In this case you’ll use your phone’s camera to take pictures of each page of all required documents.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can then attach the individual pictures (in JPG format) for each document to your email to the registry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the scans are on your computer, you’ll be able to attach them to your email.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also use the free app Adobe Scan which is available for both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/adobe-scan-mobile-pdf-scanner/id1199564834" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.scan.android&hl=en_CA" target="_blank">Android</a> devices. This will easily allow you to create a PDF for each document you require. Once the PDFs are created, e-mail them to yourself and attach them to your email. For more information on using Adobe Scan see <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/adobescan/android/en/scan.html" target="_blank"> Adobe’s help for Scanning.</a>

            Scanning using a Service
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are many businesses who specialize in providing scanning services to those in need. Search for a suitable business near you and ask about the services they provide and their cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately you’d like PDF copies of each document emailed to you so that you can attach them to an email from the same computer you used to complete the application.
